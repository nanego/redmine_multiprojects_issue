Redmine Multiprojects Issue plugin
======================

[![5.1.3][1]][5]
[![4.2.11][2]][5]

This redmine plugin allows you to specify more than one project per issue.

Cross-projects issues appear in all related projects. They can be viewed by every users who have enough permission on at least one related project, but can be updated only by users who have enough permissions on the main project (the project used to create the issue).

Do not forget to add the "View multi-projects issues" permission to authorized roles.
